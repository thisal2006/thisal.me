# Thisal Sandayuru's Portfolio Website
Professional portfolio site built from my CV.

## Issues Noted
- Current design feels boring: Add unique features like particle background, more animations.
- Layout is messy: Clean up sections, improve spacing, make timeline more visual.
- Make it unique: Add 3D tilt effect on project cards, confetti on resume download.

## Upcoming Changes
- Enhance CSS for better aesthetics.
- Update JS for new features.
- Keep static HTML/JS for simplicity, but make it feel dynamic.
